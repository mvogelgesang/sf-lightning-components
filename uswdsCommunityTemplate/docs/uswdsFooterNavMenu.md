# US Web Design System Footer Navigation Menu

Displays a multi-tiered navigation menu (labels and sub-items). Component expects a navigation menu made up of solely labels and sub-items. First tier navigation links will not be displayed. For menus made up of only first tier links, use [uswdsFooterNavMenuSmall](https://github.com/gsa/sf-lightning-components/tree/master/uswdsFooterNavMenuSmall). To see how this fits together into a larger site footer, see [uswdsFooterBig](https://github.com/gsa/sf-lightning-components/tree/master/uswdsFooterBig).
